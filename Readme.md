To make use of the button shortcuts in my StartupMacros.txt file, just copy the file into ImageJ's macros directory. It will overwrite the default StartupMacros.txt file that comes with ImageJ, but my version does not alter any of the functionality of the original file, it only adds new keyboard shortcuts.
